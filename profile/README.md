Non-Destructive Editing:

Pixelmator Pro uses a non-destructive editing workflow, meaning you can make changes to your images without permanently altering the original file. Layers, adjustments, and effects are applied non-destructively, so you can revert to any previous state at any time.
Powerful Image Editing Tools:

Layer-Based Editing: Like many professional tools, Pixelmator Pro works with layers, making it easy to manage multiple elements in a composition.

Color Correction and Adjustment: Pixelmator Pro offers a wide range of color correction and enhancement tools, including curves, levels, color balance, hue/saturation adjustments, and gradient maps.
Machine Learning and AI Features:

ML Enhance: This tool automatically adjusts the image to improve its overall look using machine learning, analyzing the photo and making intelligent adjustments to exposure, contrast, saturation, etc.
Super Resolution: This AI-powered feature can increase the resolution of an image without losing sharpness or introducing noise, useful for enlarging images for print or high-quality output.
Vector Tools:

Pixelmator Pro includes a variety of vector tools for creating illustrations, logos, and other graphics. You can combine both vector and raster elements in the same project, making it versatile for different types of design work.
## Brushes and Painting Tools:

A suite of brushes is available for painting and sketching. You can customize brushes and use pressure sensitivity if you're using a tablet, offering a more natural painting experience.
Dynamic Paintbrushes: Simulate realistic brush strokes, and Pixelmator Pro supports various brush types like oil, watercolor, and pastels.
Photo Enhancements:

Features like Auto White Balance, Noise Reduction, and Sharpening help in enhancing photos quickly and easily, making the editing process faster while still maintaining a high level of quality.
Text and Typography:

Pixelmator Pro supports powerful text tools with extensive control over font, style, alignment, and spacing. You can also create text effects, including shadows, outlines, and more.
Advanced Export Options:

The app supports exporting in multiple formats, including PSD (for compatibility with Adobe Photoshop), TIFF, PNG, JPG, HEIF, and more. Additionally, you can export assets for web, print, and even mobile applications with optimized settings.
## Seamless Integration with macOS:

Pixelmator Pro is optimized for macOS and integrates seamlessly with features like iCloud, Dark Mode, and Apple's Metal API, ensuring excellent performance on Macs with both Intel and Apple Silicon processors.
Integration with Photos: You can easily edit images directly from your macOS Photos library.
Full Screen and Split View:

The app offers a distraction-free full-screen mode, as well as split-view functionality, which is perfect for multitasking on macOS.

Pricing:
Pixelmator Pro follows a one-time purchase model. While it is relatively more affordable than many of its competitors (like Adobe Photoshop), it still provides a powerful suite of tools that can handle a wide range of professional and creative tasks.

One-Time Purchase: Pixelmator Pro is priced around $39.99 (USD), which includes all updates for the app.
Comparison to Competitors:
Adobe Photoshop: While Photoshop is the industry standard, Pixelmator Pro offers much of the same functionality at a fraction of the price. For users who need more advanced tools like 3D modeling or specific video editing features, Photoshop may still be preferred, but for most photo editing, design, and illustration needs, Pixelmator Pro is more than capable.
Affinity Photo: Another popular alternative, Affinity Photo provides a similar set of tools, with a more complex pricing structure. Pixelmator Pro has the edge when it comes to user experience and macOS optimization.
## Conclusion:
Pixelmator Pro is an excellent alternative to other high-end image editing software for macOS users. It combines power, ease of use, and affordability, making it a great option for anyone from casual photographers to professionals. With its extensive set of tools, support for non-destructive editing, and seamless integration with macOS, it stands as one of the best photo editing solutions on the Mac platform.
